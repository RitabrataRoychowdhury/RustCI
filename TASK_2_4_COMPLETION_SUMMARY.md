## Code Changes Made

### Main Application (src/main.rs)
```rust
// Enhanced error reporting with detailed remediation suggestions
if !validation_report.remediation_suggestions.is_empty() {
    info!("üìã Configuration Remediation Guide:");
    for (i, suggestion) in validation_report.remediation_suggestions.iter().enumerate() {
        let severity_icon = match suggestion.severity {
            RemediationSeverity::Critical => "üö®",
            RemediationSeverity::High => "‚ùå",
            RemediationSeverity::Medium => "‚ö†Ô∏è",
            RemediationSeverity::Low => "üí°",
            RemediationSeverity::Info => "‚ÑπÔ∏è",
        };
        
        info!("  {}. {} [{}] {}", i + 1, severity_icon, suggestion.category, suggestion.issue);
        info!("     üí° Suggestion: {}", suggestion.suggestion);
        
        if let Some(example) = &suggestion.example {
            info!("     üìù Example: {}", example);
        }
        
        if let Some(docs) = &suggestion.documentation_link {
            info!("     üìö Documentation: {}", docs);
        }
    }
}

// Enhanced startup readiness checking with detailed statistics
match validation_report.startup_readiness {
    StartupReadiness::Ready => {
        info!("‚úÖ Configuration validation passed - starting application");
        info!("üéØ All {} configuration checks passed successfully", 
              validation_report.configuration_summary.total_configuration_keys);
    }
    StartupReadiness::ReadyWithWarnings => {
        warn!("‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration validation passed with warnings - starting application");
        warn!("üìä {} warnings found - consider addressing them for optimal performance", 
              validation_report.validation_report.total_warnings());
        warn!("üîß {} remediation suggestions available", 
              validation_report.remediation_suggestions.len());
    }
    // ... additional enhanced error handling
}

// Configuration migration summary logging
if let Some(migration_report) = &validation_report.migration_report {
    if migration_report.total_migrations > 0 {
        info!("üì¶ Configuration Migration Summary:");
        info!("   ‚úÖ {} migrations applied successfully", migration_report.successful_migrations);
        if migration_report.failed_migrations > 0 {
            warn!("   ‚ùå {} migrations failed", migration_report.failed_migrations);
        }
        
        for migration in &migration_report.migrations_applied {
            let status_icon = if migration.success { "‚úÖ" } else { "‚ùå" };
            info!("   {} v{}: {}", status_icon, migration.version, migration.description);
            
            if !migration.changes.is_empty() {
                for change in &migration.changes {
                    info!("      - {}", change);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
