### Key Security Findings

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Protected endpoints require authentication
- OAuth flow properly initiated
- Invalid tokens rejected
- Malformed headers handled

#### Input Validation
- SQL injection prevention tested
- XSS payload sanitization verified
- Command injection blocking validated
- Oversized payload handling checked

#### Rate Limiting

- Security headers presence verified

#### Session Security
- Cookie security attributes checked
- Session management practices reviewed

#### API Security
- HTTP method security validated
- API versioning security tested
- Path traversal prevention verified

### Security Recommendations

1. **Authentication Enhancement**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication
   - Add session timeout controls
   - Enhance token validation

2. **Input Validation**
   - Strengthen input sanitization
   - Add content type validation
   - Implement request size limits

3. **Security Headers**
   - Add missing security headers
   - Configure Content Security Policy
   - Implement HSTS if using HTTPS

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Fine-tune rate limit thresholds
   - Add per-user rate limiting
   - Implement progressive delays

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Add security event logging
   - Implement intrusion detection
   - Set up security alerting

### Test Files Generated

### Security Score

Based on the security tests performed, the application demonstrates:

- ✅ Basic authentication protection
- ✅ Input validation mechanisms
- ✅ API security controls
- ⚠️ Some security headers missing
- ⚠️ Rate limiting may need tuning

### Conclusion

The RustCI application shows good foundational security practices with proper
authentication requirements and input validation. Additional security hardening
is recommended for production deployment.
