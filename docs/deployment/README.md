### Platform-Specific Guides

#### Container Orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Full-featured deployment with scaling and monitoring
- **Docker Compose**: Simple multi-container deployment
- **Docker Swarm**: Docker-native orchestration

#### Cloud Platforms
- **AWS**: EKS, ECS, and EC2 deployment options
- **Google Cloud**: GKE and Compute Engine deployment
- **Azure**: AKS and Container Instances deployment

### Configuration Management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secret management
- Configuration validation
- Hot-reload capabilities

### Monitoring and Observability
- Metrics collection and monitoring
- Distributed tracing setup
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Health checks and alerting

## Quick Start Deployments

### Docker Compose (Development)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rustci/rustci.git
cd rustci

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes (Production)
```bash
# Apply Kubernetes manifests
kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes/

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n rustci-system
```

### Helm Chart
```bash
# Add RustCI Helm repository
helm repo add rustci https://charts.rustci.dev

# Install RustCI
helm install rustci rustci/rustci
```

## Production Considerations

### Security
- TLS/SSL configuration
- Authentication and authorization
- Network security policies
- Secret management

### Performance
- Resource allocation and limits
- Auto-scaling configuration
- Load balancing setup
- Performance monitoring

### High Availability
- Multi-node deployment
- Database clustering
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Health checks and failover

### Maintenance
- Rolling updates
- Configuration management
- Log rotation
- Monitoring and alerting

## Environment-Specific Configurations

### Development
- Minimal resource requirements
- Debug logging enabled
- Hot-reload configuration
- Local storage options

### Staging
- Production-like environment
- Performance testing setup
- Integration testing configuration
- Monitoring and alerting

### Production
- High availability setup
- Security hardening
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive monitoring
