# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the RustCI project. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development of the system.

## ADR Template

When creating a new ADR, use the following template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the context and problem statement]

## Decision
[Describe the decision made]

## Consequences
[Describe the consequences of the decision]

## Alternatives Considered
[List alternatives that were considered]

## References
[List any references or related documents]
```

## ADR Process

1. **Proposal**: Create a new ADR with status "Proposed"
2. **Review**: Team reviews the ADR and provides feedback
3. **Decision**: ADR is either "Accepted" or "Rejected"
4. **Implementation**: If accepted, implement the decision
5. **Maintenance**: Update ADR status if it becomes "Deprecated" or "Superseded"

## Guidelines

- ADRs should be immutable once accepted
- If a decision needs to be changed, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
- Keep ADRs concise but comprehensive
- Include diagrams where helpful
- Reference related ADRs and external documentation
