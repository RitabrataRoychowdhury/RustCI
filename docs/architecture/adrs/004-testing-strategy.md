# ADR-004: Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The RustCI system requires a robust testing strategy to ensure reliability, maintainability, and confidence in deployments. The system has complex interactions between components, external services, and infrastructure that need to be thoroughly tested.

Key challenges:
- Complex distributed system with multiple components
- Integration with external services (GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes)
- Need for different types of testing (unit, integration, load, chaos)
- Test isolation and repeatability
- Performance and scalability validation
- Deployment validation and rollback testing

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive multi-layered testing strategy with the following components:

### 1. Test Organization Structure
```
tests/
├── unit/           # Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/    # Integration tests for component interactions
├── load/          # Load and performance testing
├── chaos/         # Chaos engineering tests
└── common/        # Shared test utilities and infrastructure
```

### 2. Testing Layers

#### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Use dependency injection for mocking external dependencies
- Achieve >90% code coverage for core business logic
- Fast execution (<1 second per test)

#### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions and API endpoints
- Use test containers for external dependencies
- Test database operations with isolated test databases
- Validate end-to-end workflows

#### Load Tests
- Validate system performance under expected load
- Test concurrent pipeline executions
- Measure response times and throughput
- Identify performance bottlenecks

#### Chaos Tests
- Test system resilience under failure conditions
- Inject network failures, database outages, service crashes
- Validate graceful degradation and recovery
- Ensure system maintains core functionality during failures

### 3. Test Infrastructure

#### Common Test Utilities
- Builder patterns for test data creation
- Mock services for external dependencies
- Test database management
- Container orchestration for integration tests
- Custom assertions and test macros

#### Test Environment Management
- Isolated test environments for each test suite
- Automatic cleanup of test resources
- Configuration management for different test scenarios
- Test data fixtures and factories

### 4. Testing Tools and Frameworks

#### Core Testing
- `tokio-test` for async testing
- `mockall` for mocking
- `testcontainers` for integration testing
- Custom test harness for specialized scenarios

#### Load Testing
- Custom load testing framework built on Tokio
- Configurable load patterns and scenarios
- Detailed performance metrics collection
- Automated performance regression detection

#### Chaos Testing
- Custom chaos engineering framework
- Pluggable failure injection methods
- Steady-state hypothesis validation
- Automated recovery verification

### 5. Test Execution Strategy

#### Continuous Integration
- Unit tests run on every commit
- Integration tests run on pull requests
- Load tests run nightly
- Chaos tests run weekly

#### Test Parallelization
- Unit tests run in parallel by default
- Integration tests use isolated resources
- Load tests coordinate to avoid resource conflicts
- Chaos tests run in dedicated environments

#### Test Reporting
- Detailed test results with timing information
- Coverage reports for unit tests
- Performance metrics for load tests
- Resilience reports for chaos tests

## Consequences

### Positive
- High confidence in system reliability and performance
- Early detection of regressions and performance issues
- Improved system resilience through chaos testing
- Better documentation through test scenarios
- Faster development cycles with comprehensive test coverage

### Negative
- Increased complexity in test infrastructure
- Additional maintenance overhead for test code
- Longer CI/CD pipeline execution times
- Resource requirements for test environments
- Learning curve for team members

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Test maintenance overhead
  - **Mitigation**: Invest in test utilities and automation
- **Risk**: Flaky tests affecting CI/CD
  - **Mitigation**: Implement retry mechanisms and test stability monitoring
- **Risk**: Test environment costs
  - **Mitigation**: Use ephemeral test environments and resource optimization

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Minimal Testing Strategy
- Only unit tests and basic integration tests
- **Rejected**: Insufficient for a distributed system

### 2. External Testing Tools Only
- Use only third-party testing frameworks
- **Rejected**: Doesn't provide sufficient control and customization

### 3. Manual Testing Focus
- Rely primarily on manual testing
- **Rejected**: Not scalable and error-prone

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up test directory structure
- Implement common test utilities
- Create test data builders and fixtures
- Set up basic unit test infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Testing (Week 3-4)
- Implement comprehensive unit tests
- Set up integration test framework
- Create test container management
- Implement database testing utilities

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing (Week 5-6)
- Implement load testing framework
- Create chaos testing infrastructure
- Set up performance monitoring
- Implement test reporting

### Phase 4: Integration (Week 7-8)
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- Set up automated test execution
- Implement test result reporting
- Create test documentation

## Success Metrics

- Unit test coverage >90% for core components
- Integration test coverage for all API endpoints
- Load test scenarios for expected traffic patterns
- Chaos test scenarios for critical failure modes
- Test execution time <10 minutes for unit tests
- Test execution time <30 minutes for integration tests
- Zero flaky tests in CI/CD pipeline
