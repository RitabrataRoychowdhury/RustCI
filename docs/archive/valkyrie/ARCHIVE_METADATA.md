# Valkyrie Archive Metadata

## Archive Information
- **Original Location:** `docs/valkyrie/`
- **Archived Date:** 2025-01-09
- **Reason:** Outdated branding - replaced with RustCI terminology

## Content Description
This directory contains documentation that was specific to the "Valkyrie" naming convention, which has been replaced with "RustCI" throughout the project. These documents include:

- Valkyrie API reference documentation
- Valkyrie deployment guides
- Valkyrie observability documentation
- Valkyrie-specific configuration examples

## Historical Context
The "Valkyrie" name was used during earlier phases of the project development. The project has since been rebranded to "RustCI" to better reflect its purpose as a Rust-based CI/CD system. This archived content preserves the original documentation for historical reference.

## Current Documentation
For current RustCI documentation, please refer to:
- `docs/api/` - Current API reference and guides
- `docs/deployment/` - Current deployment documentation
- `docs/user/` - User guides and examples
- `docs/architecture/` - System architecture documentation

## Migration Notes
All functionality described in the archived Valkyrie documentation is still available in RustCI, but with updated terminology and potentially improved interfaces. Users should refer to the current documentation for accurate information.
