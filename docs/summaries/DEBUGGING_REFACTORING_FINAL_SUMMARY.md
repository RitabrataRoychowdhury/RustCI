## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic Approach**: Following the structured task plan was effective
2. **Incremental Progress**: Fixing issues in priority order prevented regression
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation aided validation process
4. **Tooling**: Created reusable scripts for ongoing maintenance

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Integration Complexity**: Valkyrie-RustCI integration more complex than anticipated
2. **Type System**: Rust's type system required careful attention to trait bounds

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Total Dependencies | ~108 | 98 | -9% |
| Compilation Errors | 200+ | 152* | -24% |
| Module Circular Deps | Multiple | 0 | -100% |
| Build Profile Optimization | Basic | Advanced | Significant |
