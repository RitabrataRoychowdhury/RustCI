# Build Performance Optimization Summary

## Task 5: Optimize build performance and dependencies

### Dependencies Removed

The following unused dependencies were identified and removed from `Cargo.toml`:

1. **fastrand** - Random number generation (not used in codebase)
2. **hostname** - System hostname utilities (not used in codebase)  
3. **socket2** - Low-level socket utilities (not used in codebase)
4. **aligned-vec** - SIMD-aligned vectors (not used in codebase)
5. **simd-json** - SIMD-optimized JSON parsing (not used in codebase)
6. **serde_urlencoded** - URL encoding for HTTP (not used in codebase)
7. **async-stream** - Async stream utilities (not used in codebase)
8. **num_cpus** - CPU count detection (not used in codebase)
9. **urlencoding** - URL encoding utilities (not used in codebase)
10. **time** - External time crate (std::time is used instead)

### Build Profile Optimizations

#### Release Profile Changes
- **opt-level**: Changed from "z" (size) to 3 (speed) for better runtime performance
- **lto**: Changed from `true` (full LTO) to "thin" for faster builds while maintaining most optimizations
- **codegen-units**: Increased from 1 to 16 to enable parallel compilation

#### Development Profile Additions
- **opt-level**: Set to 0 for fastest compilation
- **debug**: Enabled for debugging support
- **split-debuginfo**: Set to "unpacked" for faster linking on macOS
- **incremental**: Enabled for faster incremental builds

#### Test Profile Additions
- **opt-level**: Set to 0 for fastest test compilation
- **debug**: Enabled for test debugging
- **incremental**: Enabled for faster incremental test builds

### Feature Flag Optimizations

Added structured feature flags:
- **default**: Now includes only "core-features"
- **core-features**: Base functionality
- **simd-optimizations**: Optional SIMD features
- **zero-copy**: Optional zero-copy optimizations
- Language binding features remain optional

### Build Configuration

Added build optimization:
- **target-cpu=native**: Optimizes for the current CPU architecture

### Performance Impact

#### Expected Improvements:
1. **Faster incremental builds** due to increased codegen-units and optimized dev profile
2. **Reduced dependency compilation** from removing 10 unused crates
3. **Better runtime performance** with opt-level=3 in release builds
4. **Faster linking** with split-debuginfo on macOS
5. **CPU-optimized code** with target-cpu=native

#### Trade-offs:
- Release builds may be slightly larger due to opt-level=3 vs "z"
- Thin LTO provides most benefits of full LTO with faster build times

### Validation Tools

Created two scripts for ongoing optimization:

1. **scripts/measure-build-time.sh**: Measures build performance across different scenarios
2. **scripts/analyze-dependencies.sh**: Analyzes dependency usage and identifies unused crates

### Dependency Count Reduction

- **Before**: ~108 total dependencies (including removed ones)
- **After**: 98 total dependencies
- **Reduction**: 10 unused dependencies removed (~9% reduction)

### Next Steps

1. Run `./scripts/measure-build-time.sh` to establish baseline performance metrics
2. Monitor build times during development to ensure optimizations are effective
3. Periodically run `./scripts/analyze-dependencies.sh` to identify new unused dependencies
4. Consider enabling specific feature flags only when needed to reduce compilation scope

### Requirements Satisfied

✅ **5.1**: Removed unused crates from Cargo.toml (10 dependencies removed)  
✅ **5.2**: Optimized feature flags and compilation settings (profiles, features, build config)  
✅ **5.3**: Created tools to measure and validate build time improvements  
✅ **5.4**: Documented all optimizations and their expected impact
