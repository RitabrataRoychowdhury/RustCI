# Getting Started with RustCI

Welcome to RustCI! This comprehensive getting started guide will take you from zero to running your first CI/CD pipeline.

## What is RustCI?

RustCI is a high-performance, distributed CI/CD system built in Rust. It provides:

- **Fast Pipeline Execution**: Optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Distributed Architecture**: Scale across multiple nodes
- **Multiple Runner Types**: Docker, Kubernetes, and native execution
- **Flexible Configuration**: YAML-based pipeline definitions
- **Enterprise Features**: Security, observability, and high availability

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Memory**: At least 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 10GB free disk space
- **Network**: Internet connection for downloading dependencies

### Optional Prerequisites
- **Docker**: For Docker-based pipelines
- **Kubernetes**: For Kubernetes runner support
- **Git**: For source code management integration

## Installation Options

Choose the installation method that best fits your environment:

### Option 1: Quick Install (Recommended for Testing)
```bash
# Download and install RustCI
curl -sSL https://install.rustci.dev | bash

# Verify installation
rustci --version
```

### Option 2: Package Manager Install
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install rustci

# macOS with Homebrew
brew install rustci

# Windows with Chocolatey
choco install rustci
```

### Option 3: From Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rustci/rustci.git
cd rustci

# Build and install
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/rustci /usr/local/bin/
```

For detailed installation instructions, see the [Installation Guide](../installation.md).

## Your First Pipeline

Let's create and run your first RustCI pipeline:

### Step 1: Create a Project Directory
```bash
mkdir my-first-pipeline
cd my-first-pipeline
```

### Step 2: Create a Pipeline Configuration
Create a file named `pipeline.yaml`:

```yaml
# pipeline.yaml
name: "My First Pipeline"
version: "1.0"

stages:
  - name: "hello"
    jobs:
      - name: "say-hello"
        runner: "native"
        steps:
          - name: "greet"
            run: "echo 'Hello from RustCI!'"
          - name: "show-date"
            run: "date"
```

### Step 3: Run the Pipeline
```bash
# Run the pipeline
rustci run pipeline.yaml

# Expected output:
# âœ… Pipeline 'My First Pipeline' started
# âœ… Stage 'hello' started
# âœ… Job 'say-hello' started
# Hello from RustCI!
# Thu Jan  9 10:30:00 UTC 2025
# âœ… Job 'say-hello' completed successfully
# âœ… Stage 'hello' completed successfully
# âœ… Pipeline 'My First Pipeline' completed successfully
```

Congratulations! You've just run your first RustCI pipeline! ðŸŽ‰

## Understanding the Pipeline

Let's break down what happened:

### Pipeline Structure
```yaml
name: "My First Pipeline"    # Human-readable pipeline name
version: "1.0"              # Pipeline version for tracking

stages:                     # Stages run sequentially
  - name: "hello"           # Stage name
    jobs:                   # Jobs within a stage run in parallel
      - name: "say-hello"   # Job name
        runner: "native"    # Runner type (native, docker, kubernetes)
        steps:              # Steps within a job run sequentially
          - name: "greet"   # Step name
            run: "echo 'Hello from RustCI!'"  # Command to execute
```

### Key Concepts
- **Pipeline**: The complete CI/CD workflow
- **Stages**: Sequential phases of the pipeline
- **Jobs**: Parallel units of work within a stage
- **Steps**: Individual commands or actions within a job
- **Runners**: Execution environments (native, Docker, Kubernetes)
