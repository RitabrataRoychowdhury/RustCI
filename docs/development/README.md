### Development Workflows

#### Setting Up Development Environment
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Rust toolchain (latest stable)
3. Install dependencies: `cargo build`
4. Run tests: `cargo test`
5. Start development server: `cargo run`

#### Code Standards
- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Write comprehensive tests for new features
- Document public APIs
- Use `cargo fmt` for code formatting
- Run `cargo clippy` for linting

#### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Security tests for authentication and authorization

## Architecture for Developers

Understanding RustCI's architecture is crucial for effective development:

- **Modular Design**: Components are organized into clear modules
- **Plugin System**: Extensible through plugins
- **Communication Protocol**: High-performance inter-component communication
- **Runner System**: Flexible execution environment support
