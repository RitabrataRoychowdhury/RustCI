# Control Plane Master Component Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented the **Control Plane Master Component** as specified in task 1 of the k8s-control-plane-enhancement specification. This component serves as the main orchestrator that coordinates existing cluster components and provides centralized job orchestration, runner management, and deployment capabilities.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. ControlPlaneMaster Struct
- **Location**: `src/core/control_plane.rs`
- **Purpose**: Main orchestrator that coordinates cluster operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Integrates with existing `ClusterCoordinator` and `NodeRegistry`
  - Manages control plane lifecycle (Initializing → Starting → Running → Stopping → Stopped)
  - Provides unified API for cluster operations
  - Event-driven architecture with comprehensive event handling
  - Metrics collection and monitoring

### 2. Control Plane Configuration
- **ControlPlaneConfig**: Main configuration structure
- **ControlPlaneSettings**: Control plane specific settings including:
  - High availability mode
  - Leader election timeout
  - Heartbeat intervals
  - Auto-failover capabilities
  - API port configuration
  - Metrics collection settings

### 3. Control Plane State Management
- **ControlPlaneState Enum**: Comprehensive state tracking
  - `Initializing`, `Starting`, `Running`, `ElectingLeader`
  - `Leader`, `Follower`, `Degraded`, `Stopping`, `Stopped`, `Failed`
- **State Transitions**: Automatic state management with event publishing

### 4. Event System Integration
- **ControlPlaneEvent**: Domain events for coordination
  - Started, Stopped, LeaderElected, LeaderLost
  - StateChanged, ClusterEvent forwarding
- **Event Bus Integration**: Full integration with existing event system
- **Event Processing**: Background event processing with correlation tracking

### 5. Metrics and Monitoring
- **ControlPlaneMetrics**: Comprehensive metrics collection
  - Uptime, managed clusters, node counts
  - Job processing statistics
  - Resource utilization tracking
  - Health status monitoring
- **Background Metrics Collection**: Automatic metrics updates

## Integration with Existing Components

### ClusterCoordinator Integration
- ✅ Wraps and coordinates existing cluster operations
- ✅ Forwards cluster events through control plane event system
- ✅ Provides unified interface for cluster management
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

### NodeRegistry Integration
- ✅ Leverages existing node management capabilities
- ✅ Integrates node lifecycle with control plane state
- ✅ Provides centralized node coordination

### JobScheduler Integration
- ✅ Coordinates with existing job scheduling infrastructure
- ✅ Provides distributed job scheduling capabilities
- ✅ Maintains job execution statistics

### EventBus Integration
- ✅ Full integration with existing event-driven architecture
- ✅ Publishes control plane events for system-wide coordination
- ✅ Supports correlation tracking for distributed operations

## API Surface

### Core Operations
```rust
// Lifecycle management
async fn start(&self) -> Result<()>
async fn stop(&self, reason: String) -> Result<()>

// State and metrics
async fn get_state(&self) -> ControlPlaneState
async fn get_metrics(&self) -> ControlPlaneMetrics

// Cluster operations
async fn get_cluster_info(&self) -> Cluster
async fn get_cluster_status(&self) -> ClusterStatus
async fn get_cluster_metrics(&self) -> ClusterMetrics

// Node management
async fn join_node(&self, node: ClusterNode) -> Result<ClusterNode>
async fn leave_node(&self, node_id: NodeId, reason: String) -> Result<()>
async fn get_cluster_nodes(&self) -> Result<Vec<ClusterNode>>
async fn get_active_nodes(&self) -> Result<Vec<ClusterNode>>

// Job distribution
async fn distribute_job(&self, job_id: JobId) -> Result<JobDistribution>
```

## Requirements Compliance

- ✅ Provides unified control plane interface
- ✅ Event-driven coordination between components

### Requirement 1.3: Lifecycle Management ✅
- ✅ Comprehensive lifecycle state management
- ✅ Graceful startup and shutdown procedures
- ✅ Configuration management and validation
- ✅ Health monitoring and status reporting

## Testing

### Unit Tests Implemented
- ✅ Control plane creation and initialization
- ✅ State transition management
