# Native Runner Enhancements Summary

## Task Completed: Add Self-Contained Native Runner with Enhanced Lifecycle Management

### Overview
Successfully enhanced the existing NativeProcessRunner with comprehensive lifecycle management capabilities for control plane coordination, as specified in task 2 of the k8s-control-plane-enhancement spec.

### Key Enhancements Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Lifecycle Management
- **Resource Monitoring**: Added continuous monitoring of CPU, memory, and disk usage
- **Job Timeout Monitoring**: Automatic detection and handling of timed-out jobs
- **Isolation Cleanup**: Periodic cleanup of orphaned isolation contexts (process groups, namespaces, cgroups)
- **Capacity Management**: Real-time capacity tracking and reporting

#### 2. Control Plane Coordination
- **Auto-Registration**: Automatic registration with control plane on startup
- **Enhanced Heartbeats**: Comprehensive heartbeat system with status reporting
- **Health Monitoring**: Distributed health checks with cluster-aware status aggregation
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Rich event system for control plane coordination

#### 3. Process Isolation Enhancements
- **Multiple Isolation Levels**: Support for None, ProcessGroup, Namespace (Linux), and Cgroup (Linux) isolation
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable CPU, memory, execution time, and process limits
- **Isolation Context Management**: Proper tracking and cleanup of isolation contexts

#### 4. Advanced Runner Operations
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Coordinated shutdown with job completion waiting
- **Runner Migration**: Support for moving runners between nodes for maintenance
- **Failure Recovery**: Automatic handling of job failures and rescheduling

#### 5. Configuration Flexibility
- **Multiple Factory Methods**: Various factory methods for different use cases (development, production, high-performance)
- **Environment-Specific Configs**: Tailored configurations for different deployment scenarios
- **Control Plane Integration**: Seamless integration with existing control plane infrastructure

### Technical Implementation Details

#### New Methods Added
- `start_enhanced_lifecycle_management()`: Coordinates all lifecycle management tasks
- `register_with_control_plane()`: Handles automatic registration
- `start_resource_monitoring()`: Monitors system resources
- `start_job_timeout_monitoring()`: Handles job timeouts
- `start_isolation_cleanup()`: Cleans up orphaned isolation contexts
- `start_capacity_management()`: Manages and reports capacity
- `graceful_shutdown()`: Implements graceful shutdown with timeout
- `migrate_to_node()`: Handles runner migration between nodes
- `collect_resource_usage()`: Collects comprehensive resource metrics

#### Event System Integration
- **Custom Events**: Added support for RunnerRegistration, ResourceUsage, JobTimeout, CapacityUpdate, RunnerShutdown, and RunnerMigration events
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: All lifecycle operations emit events for control plane coordination
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking event processing for better performance

#### Testing Coverage
- Added comprehensive unit tests for all new functionality
- Tests cover enhanced lifecycle management, resource monitoring, migration, and graceful shutdown
- All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring backward compatibility

### Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 4.1**: Native process execution without Docker/K8s dependencies
✅ **Requirement 4.2**: Process isolation using OS-level mechanisms
✅ **Requirement 4.3**: Self-contained deployment capability
✅ **Requirement 2.1**: Automatic runner discovery and registration
✅ **Requirement 2.2**: Enhanced lifecycle management with control plane coordination

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- Existing Docker and Kubernetes runners continue to work unchanged
- Enhanced features are opt-in through configuration
- Graceful degradation when control plane features are disabled

### Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous task execution for all monitoring activities
- Efficient resource usage tracking
- Minimal overhead when enhanced features are disabled
- Proper cleanup to prevent resource leaks

### Security Enhancements
- Process isolation at multiple levels
- Resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Secure event communication
- Proper cleanup of sensitive isolation contexts

This implementation provides a robust foundation for the control plane enhancement while maintaining the simplicity and reliability of the existing native runner system.
